My first foray into understanding how actual interpreters and compilers work, following this excellent
book, [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/ "Crafting Interpreters") by Bob Nystrom. 

## Additions 
Alongside the features supported in Crafting Interpreters, I've added - 

1. Do-while loops
2. Break, Continue statements
3. Bitwise operators ( ~, &, ^, | )
4. Exponeniation operator \*\* 
5. Modulo operator % 
6. Ternary operator ?:
7. Comma operator ,
8. Nested /**/ comments
